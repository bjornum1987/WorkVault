#### Tip 1.  Set your own macro targets.
- Dont let [[MyFitnessPal]] decide how many calories to eat.
- Its a great Diet tool, but Bad dieting tool.
- Type in your own calories and nutrition macros to track.
- Me -> Goals -> Calorie, Carbs, Protein and Fat Goals.
- Fat and Protein goals are daily minimums.
- Carbohydrate goals are daily maximums

#### Tip 2. Turn off step adjustments
- Belives you should be eating back the calories you burn... WRONG
- Me -> Goals -> Exercise Calories -> turn off Adjust my calorie goal
- Hamburger top left -> Steps -> Dont track steps

#### Tip 3. Use the search bar for whole food ingredients and chain resturants.
- Diary tab is the most important tab on the app.
- Diary -> Meal 1 -> Add food -> Search if unable to scan.
- Can even find chain like chipotle, where you can plan your entire meal. 
	- Note: Many resturants display abit less calories, so keep it in mind.

#### Tip 4. Scan Barcodes.
- Simple: Scan the barcodes.
- Check the nutrition on the package, if in doubt.

#### Tip 5. Outsource to websites like CalorieKing for untrackable food items.
- Remember, there will not always be 100% accurate readings on food.
	- This is ok.
- Try eating using the [[80% 20% nutrition guideline]]
	- 80% on point "clean" Calories.
	- 20% Estimated "fun" Calories.

#### Tip 6. Get a Food Scale and measure everything in grams.
- When tracking an item, and you know its values.
- Dont asume that the item you eat weigh the number you track!.
  - Example: cooked chicken breast. 
- Bonus Tip: Raw vs Cooked meat.
	- Raw meat will weight more, and are more accurate to track
- Example 2: Cereal.
	- You know how much 100 gram are.
	- Weight it, and then adjust.

#### Tip 7. Weigh the deficits
- Take the container, and weigh how much you take out of them.
- This are easier, than constantly adjusting how much you currently have. 
- Instead seeing how much have been taken. Which is more accurate.

#### Tip 8. Create meals and Recipes
- Less floating variables = more control.
- Create custom meals and recipes that you like, to have a constant safe tracking of what you eat.
- Meals:
	- Consistent
	- Adjustable
	- Ingredients

#### Tip 9. Tweak other settings like food history, meal names, time stamps and etc...
- Filter by meals.
- What to show and etc.

#### Tip 10. Utilise downtime while cooking to track before you begin eating.
- Do the hard work while cooking.
- This to avoid doing so while eating.
