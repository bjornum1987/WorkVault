## Notes to sort
- Used to create:
	- Data Science Study
	- Learning a Language
	- Keeping an consistant workout routine
	- Prepare for interview questions.
	- Keep track of school assignments.
	- And ALOT more

- How it works.
	- By keeping score of things, one take it alot more serious.
	- 4 Key component, to keep a good score.
		1. Set Scoreboard Goals that are important to you.
			- The [[Wildly Important Goal]] aka the [[WIG]]
				- If important to you, then you track it better.
				- Think if its important or simply just cool.
					- Example: Wanna play guitar because its cool or passionate about it.
			- Another example: (look more into)
				- Trading, earning like 5% revenue every month.
				- End goal of becoming financial free.
		2. Your Scoreboard Needs to be Actionable.
			- Leading vs Lagging
				- Lagging Metric.
					- The thing you want to achive.
					- Metrics used to measure past performance.
					- The results
					- Cannot influence directly.
				- Leading Metric
					- Metrics used to measure future performance.
					- Things to work on, that will eventually move the Lagging Metrics.
			- Example:
				- Trading Application:  Lagging are the results.
				- Leading is what you wish to have.
				- Doing like 20-30 trades a month, will allow one to reach it eventually
		3.  Your Scoreboard Should be Realistic
			- Rather underestimate it than overestimate.
				- That way you will not as easily be un-motivated
		4. Your Scoreboard Should be Tailored to you


- How to use it!
	- Creating a Cadence of Accountablility
		- Like having a weekly meeting of how it goes.
